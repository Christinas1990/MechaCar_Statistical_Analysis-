## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Screen Shot 2022-06-15 at 8 41 33 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100255000/173965400-8e9f6783-7263-418c-9468-ead386f614c8.png)

According to the result, there are fice variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values; vehicle_length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and AWD. 
The slope of the linear model is not zero. The linear model predicts 68% as the R-squared value is 0.6825. 
Also the P-Value 5.35e-11 tells the null hypothesis is falase negative error which is not significant and probability of being its wrong is high.

All lot summary table indicates that variance of the suspension coils does not exceed 
100 pounds per square inch.(Image 3) 
On the other hand by lot table shows lot3 weights more than 100 pounds, which should be looked close into. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The two table shows the paried t-tests of each and all manufacturing lots against mean PSI of the population.
